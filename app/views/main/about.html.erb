Comm comm stands for the community communication tool. 
It is aimed at small communities that place an emphasis on communication. 
We believe in actual communication rather than the feeling of being connected (see facebook). 

Comm Comm's philosophy

1. Communication is the foundation of community. 
2. Comm comm is made for small communities not large groups
3. The site should not encourage divisions in the community
