<strong>Comm comm stands for the community communication tool.</strong>
<br>
<br>
It is aimed at small communities that place an emphasis on communication. 
<br>
We believe in actual communication rather than the feeling of being connected (see facebook). 
<br>
<br>
<strong><i>Comm Comm's philosophy</i></strong>
<br>
<br>

<strong>1.</strong> Communication is the foundation of community. 
<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Comm comm is made for small communities not large groups
<br>
<strong>3.</strong> The site should not encourage divisions in the community
